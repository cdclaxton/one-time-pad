# one-time-pad
Toy one-time pad encryption and decryption.

An example of the output from the simple application that is included:

```

Encrypted string:  t ccd-oit5ho5hoy0o fyb7c ob hhy3 oido 0au97i-

Characters for which there isn't a mapping are encryted as '-' in the above example. However,
the set of encryptable characters is easily defined.
